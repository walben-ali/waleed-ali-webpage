I am Waleed Ali, a Mathematics Lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath since 2017.  I specialise in mathematics educational practices, pedagogy and educational reforms in Higher Education.  My previous experience was in fluid dynamics and hydrodynamic stability theory.

My aim is to demystify maths in higher education and to make it accessible to a wider audience.

I am a part of the Mathematics Education [PRiME](https://prime-bath.github.io/PRiME/) group in Bath where we focus our efforts on disseminating effective teaching practices and ways of making students in higher education more engaged in their learning journey.
